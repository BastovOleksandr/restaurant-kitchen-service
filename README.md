# Restaurant kitchen service üë®‚Äçüç≥

## Overview
This project is a kitchen management system where users can manage cooks, dishes, and dish types. Users can explore a list of available dishes, see details about each dish, and view which cooks are associated with each one. Cooks can also be assigned or unassigned to dishes. The application includes search functionality, allowing users to find cooks by last name.

Other developers can easily extend the project by adding features such as more detailed user roles (e.g., head chefs), new categories for dishes, or additional functionalities like dish ratings or ingredient tracking.
